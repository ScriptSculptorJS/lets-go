# [Let's GO!](https://scriptsculptorjs.github.io/lets-go/)
Can't figure out what to do today? Use Let's GO! and have an activity suggested for you.
## Motivation
There have been times where I haven't known what I wanted to do for the day or on the weekend. I created this app to see suggestions that I may not have thought of before (using the Bored API), and a way to keep track of how many different activities I have completed and when.
## Built With
HTML5, CSS, JavaScript
## How to Use
Upon your first visit you will see messages letting you know that you currently do not have any activities nor completed ones:

![First-visit - Made with Clipchamp](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/184d200a-820e-4f4a-a778-111b63d70e58)

When getting an activity suggestion, you can just click the Get Activity button to receive any type of activity:

![Any-type-activity - Made with Clipchamp](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd66f9a0-7e69-45c3-ac0d-a3b98f3e1bf9)

Or, you can select a type from the dropdown that currently says Any Type to receive a specific type of activity:

![Specific-type-activity - Made with Clipchamp](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/57a30fcc-ac91-43eb-8cf8-e109b27edb35)

If the activity is already in your list, a message will appear to tell you to get an activity again.

You can delete an activity from your Activities list simply by clicking the "x" to the right of the activity.
